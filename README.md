# PathToAllah
An app for Muslims who struggle with salah to track progress and reconnect with their deen in a judgement free way
# Path to Allah

**Purpose**: 
This is a mobile app for Muslims who are struggling with their salah (prayer). It provides a safe space to track how many prayers you’re doing each day — without judgment — and helps build consistency slowly, with support.

**Why I’m Building This:** 
As someone who’s gone through spiritual highs and lows, I know how hard it can be to admit you’re struggling. This app is a tool I wish I had — something honest, simple, and healing.

**Tech Stack:** 
- Flutter / React Native (to be confirmed)
- Firebase / Supabase (planned backend)
- GitHub for version control

**Next Steps:** 
- Build simple UI for prayer tracker
- Add user login
- Start small testing group
